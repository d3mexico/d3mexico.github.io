Membrane proteins account for about one-third of the proteomes of organisms and include structural proteins, channels, and receptors. The mutual interactions they establish play crucial roles in organisms, as they are behind many processes such as cell signaling and protein function. These proteins and their molecular complexes present potential pharmacological targets par excellence for a variety of diseases, with very important implications for the design and discovery of new drugs. Yet, structural data coming from experiments is very scarce for this family of proteins. To overcome this problem, we propose a computational approach to predict the transmembrane multimeric protein complexes at the plasma membrane of eukaryote cells through data mining, sequence analysis, motif search, extraction, identification, and characterization of the amino acid residues at the interface of the complexes, leading to the formulation of binding sites used to parse protein sequence datasets for generating new potential interacting protein couples. Our template motif-based approach using experimental PPI recognition sites leads us to predict new binding sites in a 0-25% range of amino acid mutation rates and to thousands of new binary complexes between membrane proteins. Because of their number and diversity, these complexes and their interfaces represent potential pharmacological targets for the discovery of drugs or peptides modulating or inhibiting the interaction.
